Formula:
	
	// f(x) = a * ln( b * x + c )
	
describe:
	  a   :   the natural beings of growth rate
	  b   :   the inteligent of growth rate
	  c   :   the primary bring 
	  
	  Initvalue: a * ln( c )
	  
	  
This equation describe the natural growth of things which we normally attached.

The factor also has : when x > 10 * a , the result growth slowly to slowly very obviously.
			10 * a this value can calculate by f(x)'s growth rate lower than 0.1
